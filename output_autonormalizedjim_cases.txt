the gg_exhaust_temperature  spread has increased from about degc to degc since exhaust temperatures a g and h are the highest at degc the fuel valve_position  has increased to open spread increased from to degc temperature c appears to have changed the most decrease from to degc temperature h still read the highest at degc spread still at degc 
model_mechanical_alias  fan_ib_bearing  metal_temperature  range to check date before adapting 
the gas_generator  velocity has increased from to as high as umpp since april th sump c chip_detector  began spike around the same time period no changes seen in scavenge temperature the seismic vibration on the hp shaft also increased from to mms sump c chip_detector  still spike between and ohms gas_generator  velocity flatline at umpp 
since coming online on ib grg metal_temperature  has increased from to f id fan b fan_ib_bearing  metal_temperature  f id fanc fan_ib_bearing  metal_temperature  f id fand fan_ib_bearing  metal_temperature  f 
the gg_exhaust  spread took a step change down from to degc after the maintenance period at the end of march over the past week the spread has increased from to as high as degc exhaust_temperature  c appears to have changed the most speed and inlet_temperature  have decrease slightly over the past week exhaust_spread  at degc u spread has also increased from to degc exhaust_temperature  c continues to deviate spread trend at degc 
gg_velocity  t bn ve spike to as high as umpp it is currently trend at uppp up from an estimate of umpp gg_velocity  has stabilized at um 
both a andb motor currents dropped amps after outage and the other id fan stayed unchanged amps 
id fan a inboard sleeve bearing_temperature  was read + degf higher than model expected whil both ambient and outboard_bearing_temperature  was read_lower  it also appeared that idf a ib_bearing_temperature  was highest temperature compared with all other id fan 
starting on july gg_exhaust_temperature  spread began to alert high degc vs estimate of degc on july t h hp turbine_exhaust_temperature  began to alert actual value high degc gg_exhaust_temperature  spread has re approached the trend t h hp turbine_exhaust_temperature  is back with model and no longer alert all advising tag now trend with model 
since july the gg displacement has begun to trend higher and higher since july it has been up to umpp higher than estimate actual values are peaking around umpp 
since returning to service on temperature across all id fan have been track high on id fan a motor_ob_bearing  temperature is track as high as degf degf higher than predicted and motor stator_phase_wind  temperature is track as high as degc degc higher than predicted on id fan b motor_ob_bearing  temperature is track as high as degf degf higher than predicted and motor stator_phase_wind  temperature is track as high as degc degc higher than predicted and on id fan d motor_ob_bearing  temperature is track as high as degf degf higher than predicted and motor stator_phase_wind  temperature is track as high as degc degc higher than predicted on id fan c temperature are track degf higher than predicted weekly report current trends in screenshot ongoing cooling issue for fan or expected operating range based on ambient 
starting on august pt exhaust_pressure  took a step change up from bar to bar pt exhaust_pressure  spike as high as mbar and is now trend_lower  and closer to estimate at mbar spike continues to be seen 
since id fan a inbrd sleeve bearing_temperature  and inbrd thrust_bearing_temperature  have been track as high as degf and degf respectively degf higher than predicted the other bearing_temperature  are track as predicted and the like bearing on id fan b d are lower and track as predicted weekly report temperatures decrease and came back in line on after an increase was anything found for this issue weekly report has track as expected since has it been determined what caused it to come back in line 
stage discharge_pressure  compressor_discharge _pressure  is currently trend_low  at bar down from a model_estimate  of bar discharge_temperature  is also trend_low er at degc down from a model_estimate  of degc 
on all four id fan there are issue on the drive current and motor_speed  tag bdm sc aspdid fan a motor_speed  bdm sc aampid fan a drive current bdm sc cspdid fan c motor_speed  bdm sc campid fan c drive current bdm sc dspdid fan d motor_speed  and bdm sc dampid fan d drive current have flatline on id fan a c and d on id fan b bdm sc bspdid fan b motor_speed  and bdm sc bampid fan b drive current are returning nan due to this on id fan b our model are not currently running as the motor_current  is a mode tag 
the compressor end gearbox vibration have increased up to mils up from mils previous operation 
mechanical_model  ambient_temperature  are increase up to close to deg f these oscillations have pushed the motor and bearing_temperature  in general up nothing seems dangerous please adapt begin end present limits none faulted n 
stator_temperature  indication occasionally steps down to deg c for a single poll then returning to regular values between deg c the temperature_issue  do not correspond with motor_current  or ambient_temperature  
the c and c cfg compressor is showing nanaphoss on a compressor_speed  and axial_position  tag each 
the dp across this fan is operating between and inwc these levels are typical across the plantaphoss id fan array please adapt to stop spurious incidents model_performance  begin end present limits none faulted n 
on all bearing_metal  temperatures spike very highimmediately following startup thrust_bearing_temperature  reached as high as degc before the unit was shutdown 
model_performance  all tag name fan delta_pressure  meas acceptable date range to present description please stripe in the current fan_dp  these levels are typical across the other id fan and should not be producing incidents please avoid the valve test that occurred between and on 
bearing_temperature  tag has flatline at c and remained unchanged even after startup on 
request please turn on inlet damper_position  at the performance_model  level tag is producing good data and should correlate with load request model_performance  all tag name motor_current  acceptable date range to present since fan c went offline description increased motor_current  read attributed to plant running on rather than all four id fan increased fan_speed  is acceptable as well model_performance_tag  motor_current  source scbamp date october going forward 
model_mechanical  all tag name motor_ob_bearing  temperature motor_stator_temperature  acceptable date range to present description please stripe in higher motor_temperature  appear to be caused by higher fan_speed  due to fan c being taken oos 
the radial front bearing_temperature  has increased from to deg c on its most current operation vibration have increased a little as well the radial aft bearing_temperature  has remained_steady  
motor negative residual since trip 
on may th all bearing_metal  temperatures took a step change up the de_bearing_temperature  increased from to degc de_bearing_vibration  a & b are stable the nde_bearing_temperature  has increased from to degc the nde_bearing_vibration  has increased from to mils thrust_bearing  de pad active temperature increased from to degc and the inactive side increased from to deg c similar behavior seen on c centrifugal compressor_bearing _metal  temperatures appear to have returned to model_predicted  values bearing temperatures continue to trend with model_predicted  
model_performance_tag  name motor_current  acceptable date range to present description please stripe in current_read  down to amps this decrease is a result of the fan profile being biased for changing plant condition 
since the restart on the thrust_bearing_position  has been trend_lower  around mm down from a model_predicted  of mm other associated tag such as thrust_bearing  active temperature are trend perfectly with model_predicted  
model_performance_tag  name fan delta pres meas acceptable date range to present description please stripe in lower down to inwc fan_dp  this change can be attributed to an increase in fan demand boardman tripped on due to id fan issue these new read are likely the latest op_cond  
the de_vibration  tag_flatline  at mils and the nde thrust_bearing_temperature  flatline at deg c 
model_mechanical_tag  name motor_ib_bearing  temperature acceptable data_range  to present description please stripe in temperature up to degf looks like ambient is now higher 
the vibration on the de have increased from mils to mils the bearing speed is at a similar operational state as where the vibration were read mils there is also a change in the bearing_temperature  increase f
